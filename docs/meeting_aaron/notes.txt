Post-doc with Aaron

Meeting Notes:

Flexible within scope of two grants:
1) Dimensions of Biodiversity = Ants + Climate Change
- genomic and transcrptomic data
- community data
2) Pitcher Plant Tipping Points
- Proteome of bacteria
- Food web data

Grant money needs to be spent before the end of 2015.

Main goal of post-doc: model networks of things and look at the change
in network structure over gradients, both gradual and rapid, with the
target being networks of genomes or transcriptomes.

Details:
- Start May to June
- $42,000 + benefits
- Living at HF with rent around $700/mo.


- Project(s)?
-- Pitcher Plant?
--- Food web
--- Threshold
-- Ant
--- Climate change
-- Molecular genetics to communities?
- Term Length?
- Funding?
- Graduation sign-off? What info is required?
-- Defense scheduled for April 24th
-- Can request "In Progress" verification prior to graduation
-- This can state that all degree requirements have been met
-- Posting can be accelerated via a transcript request
-- Graduation will not post until grades are complete

--- Current Research ---
Food Webs in dynamic habitats
Frank Morton Jones and the history of carnivorous plant research
Nutrient limitation and stoichiometry of carnivorous plants
Spatial dimension of species interactions

Ants and Climate Change = Warming experiment

Foundation species in forests = Removal experiment







It turns out that I have some additional money in an
active grant that needs to be spent out - looks like at least 12,
maybe as much as 18 months of post-doc funding for (mostly)
pitcher-plant food web and threshold modeling and (some) ant and
climate change modeling, from molecular genetics to communities. To
start as soon as possible. So I thought maybe you might be interested
in starting sooner than next year, i.e., before you had heard from
NSF. But you'd have to have defended your dissertation and have PhD
sign-off before you could start.
